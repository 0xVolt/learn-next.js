# About this repository
## Learning a front-end framework... and JavaScript!
This repository does two things. First, it gets me back into the groove of studying. God knows it's been ages since I've been motivated to. Second, it serves as a journal to analyse how I pick up programming concepts, so I can find better ways to learn. Third, to fulfill the software development pre-requisites of the minor project for my sixth semester at university, I need to learn JavaScript and a front-end framework of my choosing. Welcome to this repository!

## The Approach
Learning something as vast as front-end development is taxing with the traditional approach to learning programming languages. We're going to learn React the most effective way through building at least 5 projects. Refer to the following table of contents to skip to the content you want to see.
