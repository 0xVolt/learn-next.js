# 2. About this repository
## 2.1. Learning a front-end framework... and JavaScript!
This repository does a couple of things. First, it gets me back into the groove of studying. God knows it's been ages since I've been motivated to. Second, it serves as a journal to analyse how I pick up programming concepts, so I can find better ways to learn. Third, to fulfill the software development pre-requisites of the minor project for my sixth semester at university, I need to learn JavaScript and a front-end framework of my choosing, i.e., `Next.js`. Welcome to this repository!

## 2.2. The Approach
Learning something as vast as front-end development is taxing with the traditional approach to learning programming languages. We're going to effectively learn Next.js by creating portfolio to showcase all my work.
