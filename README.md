# 2. About this repository

## 2.1. Why Next.js?

Next.js is an ideal framework to develop my project as it offers features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and built-in TypeScript support. This ensures that my website is fast, scalable and easier to maintain. Moreover, Next.js allows me to easily integrate with the backend APIs, which is crucial for a project like this that involves machine learning models.

## 2.2. The Approach

I'm following along with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjZIeA952jE) that walks me through a project from its prototype in Figma to coding it in JS with Next, which makes it easier for me to learn and build the project efficiently.
